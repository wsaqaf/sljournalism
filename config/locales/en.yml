  future_of_journalism_about: "<h5><b>About the project Future Journalism</b></h5><b>Background</b><p>The Journalism of the Future is a research and knowledge development project that has been ongoing since 2014 in a collaboration between Sweden's leading news editions: TV4, SVT, Sweden's Radio, Dagens Nyheter, Expressen, the NTM Group with the Upsala Newspaper, the Norrländska Socialdemokraten, Norrbottens-Kuriren, , Enköpings-Posten, Norrköpings Tidningar, Östgöta Correspondent, Motala Vadstena Tidning, Västerviks-Tidningen, Folkbladet, Gotlands Allehanda, Gotlands Tidningar. Up until 2019, Aftonbladet and Svenska Dagbladet were also included in the collaboration, The Journalism of the Future also collaborates with the Reuters Institute, Oxford University, Stockholm School of Economics, Södertörn University and the research company Nepa for data collection and analysis.</p><b>Purpose</b><p>The purpose of the project is to create a better understanding of how news and information is disseminated and discussed in the digital ecosystem, and to identify the necessary structures to maintain a long-term sustainable media market with an open discussion climate. Every modern democracy needs high-quality news journalism that balances tendencies for a segregated society, actively countering knowledge polarization and calling for false information dissemination. Good news journalism can serve as an open platform for an ongoing discussion about the development towards a future society. The project's ambition is to contribute to a pluralistic media landscape where the project members all compete and at the same time pushes the question of a common, self-cleaning media ethical system. It is about safeguarding what socially beneficial journalism can offer, as a basic service and a critical infrastructure to get a variety of social groups involved, activated and integrated. To a varying extent, the participating companies take an active part in the research and development projects conducted within the framework of the collaboration.</p><b>Approach and collaboration with research</b><p>One of the main aims of the project is to provide and finance basic research on media and journalism. This is an area that has been historically disadvantaged but of crucial importance for a future healthy media climate. The Future Journalism project brings together leading researchers, entrepreneurs and media companies in an ecosystem with the aim of creating new knowledge and new ideas for digital news services. The network also collaborates with international research centers and media players.</p><b>The project's view of the media market</b><p>News distribution is today a work performed by a multitude of different actors; media companies, engaged individuals, technology companies and text-processing robots are all part of the value chain for news distribution. The result is a greater news flow than ever before in history. This is a positive development that places new demands on the media players and opens up entirely new opportunities. We see great potential in further developing the role of journalism into a competitive offering for a modern society, where the democratic needs are met and the commercial goals are achieved.</p>"
